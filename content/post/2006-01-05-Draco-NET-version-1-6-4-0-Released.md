I’ve update and released a new version of Draco.NET.  This release is mainly to make it compatible with Visual Studio 2005 and MSBuild.  The following is a list of changes …

### 1.6-release-2 (1.6.4.0) ###

* Added MSBuild support
* Added Visual Studio 2005 support
* Added manual build (no polling) support
* Improved project config web page
* Fixed bug where error emails were sent repeatedly

### What is Draco.NET? ###

Draco.NET is a Windows service application designed to facilitate continuous integration. Draco.NET monitors your source code repository, automatically rebuilds your project when changes are detected and then emails you the build result along with a list of changes since the last build.
