I'd like to announce the MSBuild Community Task Collaboration Project. The project was started by me to form a directory of MSBuild Tasks for use in your build scripts. The project is also an open source collection of tasks. The project is broke into 2 web sites.

The first is [http://msbuildtasks.com/](http://msbuildtasks.com/) which is a community server install with forums and a directory of MSBuild tasks. The goal of msbuildtasks.com is to provide a common place to find tasks. Please help improve this directory by adding links to tasks that you know about.

The second site is an open source project hosted at [http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/). The goal of this site is to build a collection of tasks that is open source for the community. Please create an account on Tigris.org and join the project to help build out the tasks.

Thanks for contributing to the MSBuild community.

~ Paul
